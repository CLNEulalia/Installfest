## Github

If you haven't done so already, go to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and create
an account; be sure to write down your username and password somewhere, since
we'll be using these credentials later. Next, go to [GitHub Enterprise](https://git.generalassemb.ly) and create an account. It is recommended that you use the same username. This will be the source of your learning material throughout WDI, while your personal Github will be where you showcase your projects.


Now that you are set up with GitHub, we want this repo on your local
computer. Please follow along as I show you how to fork, clone and put the repo
in the correct directory.

-   We need to `fork and clone`
    the [orientation repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/orientation). Once you
    fork to your Github  account, make sure you copy the HTTPS clone link (It will
    look something like `https://git.generalassemb.ly/<your github name>/orientation.git`)

-   In your root directory `cd ~`, let's move to our downloads file by `cd Downloads/`,
then run `git clone <link copied from github>`.

-   Move into the `orientation` directory by typing `cd orientation/`. This directory contains another directory called `config/` containing scripts that we will run to set up our machines!
